In this example, we have a simple music player interface with an album cover, song title, 
artist name, and basic play, pause, previous, and next buttons. Remember to replace the album_cover.jpg with the actual URL of your album cover image.

Please note that this is just a basic example to demonstrate the layout. To make an actual functioning music player application,
you would need to integrate JavaScript for handling audio playback and more advanced functionalities. Also, server-side programming would be re
quired to handle the backend aspects like user accounts, playlists, and music storage.
